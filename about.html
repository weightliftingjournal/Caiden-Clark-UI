      <h3>About Us</h3>

      <p>
        If you're anything like us, you're always trying to do a little better
        each and every day, but you always seem to have too much on your mind,
        and you're trying to tackle too many things at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maybe you want to get a little fitter, or even start a new workout
        habit, but it feels like there's so much to keep track of and remember,
        and with everything else going on it sometimes feels easier to just drop
        the habit and not worry about exercise.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's where Buff comes in.
      </p>

      <p>
        We help you keep track of your workouts, your routines, as well as make
        adjustments when you increase your reps or weights, and we can even help
        you keep track of changes you need to make.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you're an experienced lifter, or looking to make a positive
        change in your fitness and health, Buff helps you keep track of what
        you're working on, so you can focus on unlocking your potential.
      </p>
