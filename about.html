      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and
        I can make this world as happy as I want it. Let your imagination be
        your guide. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We don't
        have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it
        will. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and
        have fun.
      </p>
